We are looking forward to welcoming you to Beijing for a meeting on NGVS star clusters and galaxies science! The meeting will be held June 10-13, 2019 across two different venues. The first two days, June 10-11, will be at the [Courtyard Institute](http://www.courtyardinstitute.com/?page_id=778&lang=en), a preserved, traditional Beijing "hutong" courtyard home in the old center of the city. This courtyard also hosts the [Black Sesame Kitchen](http://www.blacksesamekitchen.com/).

June 12 is currently reserved as an excursion day, and June 13 will be at the Peking University [Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn).
