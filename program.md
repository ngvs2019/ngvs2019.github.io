In order to increase discussion, we are limiting talk lengths to 5 slides per talk unless you have been otherwise notified (exceptions made for some introducing new projects). We expect that 5 slides should be no longer than 10 min. It may be useful to have additional slides for use during discussion. We have budgeted roughly equal amounts of time for discussion as for the talks themselves. Also, those who are not listed here, but wish to present a few slides should feel free to do so during the associated discussion periods.
